LINUX'S OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO YOU AS LICENSEE, AND SUPERSEDES
ANY OTHER PROPOSAL, REPRESENTATION, OR OTHER COMMUNICATION BY OR ON BEHALF
OF CLOUD LINUX RELATING TO THE SUBJECT.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE.  Cloud Linux hereby grants to you, and you accept,
a limited, nonexclusive license to use the Programs in machine-readable,
object code form only, and the user manuals accompanying the Programs (the
"Documentation"), only as authorized in this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Programs" include any updates, enhancements, modifications,
revisions, or additions to the Programs made by Cloud Linux and made available
to end-users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cloud Linux shall be under no
obligation to provide any updates, enhancements, modifications, revisions,
or additions to the Programs.  You may use one copy of the Programs only on
systems, including servers, work stations, virtual machines, blades, nodes
or disk partitions, for which you have purchased Subscription Services from
Cloud Linux or its resellers. For purposes of this Agreement, "use" of the
Programs means loading the Programs into the temporary or permanent memory
of a computer. Installation of the Programs on a network server solely for
distribution to other computers is not "use" of the Programs, and is permitted,
as long as you have purchased Subscription Services for the systems being
accessed by the Programs.  Your installation or use of the Programs grants
Cloud Linux limited access to your system information for the sole purpose
of security analysis and reporting. Such access and information collected
includes reviewing installed packages and applications, the names, sizes,
and attributes of files, source and destination IP addresses, target ports,
security rule IDs triggered, domains on the server, headers, URIs and hashes of
URIs, http post data, the server or system uptime, load, and running processes
(the 'SysInfo'). Cloud Linux's use of SysInfo, including usage for providing
improved security, may include steps to anonymize or pseudo anonymize any
personal data (including IP address). Cloud Linux may implement strategies,
in its sole determination, to adhere to any personal information laws or rules.

Cloud Linux will provide You the ability to opt out of Cloud Linux collecting
certain SysInfo. However, a decision to opt-out may impact your ability to
obtain all of the benefits of those users who opt-in to sharing the SysInfo
with Cloud Linux.

Cloud Linux may collect email addresses and names of  server administrators
for the  sole purpose of notifying server administrators regarding security
incidents, misconfigurations and updated features related to those servers

the Programs, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion thereof shall

separate agreement with Cloud Linux authorizing such commercial redistribution
or Cloud Linux has otherwise granted you permission, in writing.  You agree
not to remove any confidential or proprietary legends from the Programs.

of this Section 2, Cloud Linux will not have an adequate remedy in money
or damages. Cloud Linux shall therefore be entitled to obtain an injunction
against such breach from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon

right to seek further remedies. This Section 2 shall survive termination for
any reason.  Your obligations hereunder shall remain in effect for as long
as you continue to possess or use the Programs, or any proprietary interests
therein.  You further agree not to, and you will not permit others to, (a)
